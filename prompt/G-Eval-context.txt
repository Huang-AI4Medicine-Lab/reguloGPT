You will be given an original sentence including the molecular regulatory relationship. You will then be given a context described in the original sentence. Your task is to evaluate whether the generated context follows these explicit guidelines:
Context:\
   - It refers to the broader biological context such as a specific diseases (like a type of cancer).\
   - Directly use phrases in the input.\
   - **Do not** include biological processes as a part of the context. Common biological processes (like \"myogenesis\" or \"apoptosis\") should NOT be included as context.\
   - ***Do not** just include unclear or general biological entities, such as 'tumor', 'yeast'. In this case, indicate it as 'Null'.\
   - If there's no context mentioned, indicate it as 'Null'.\

Here are examples to generate context from the sentence. 
Sentence 1: GR-mediated FTO transactivation induces lipid accumulation in hepatocytes via demethylation of m6A on lipogenic mRNAs.
Context: Colorectal Carcinoma
Sentence2: m6A methyltransferase METTL3 facilitates tumor progression via an m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mechanism in colorectal carcinoma.
Context: Colorectal Carcinoma
Sentence3: Loss of m6A on FAM134B promotes IL-1beta-induced adipogenesis in porcine adipocytes through m6A-YTHDF2-dependent way.
Context: Porcine Adipocytes
Sentence4: The 18S rRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL5 promotes mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Context: Mouse embryonic stem cell

Evaluation Criteria:

Score (1-5) - The alignment between the context and guidelines. The maximum score is 5 and lowest score is 1. 

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the original sentence and identify the broader biological context. This could be a specific disease, a type of cell, or a specific organism. 

2. Check if the context directly uses phrases from the input sentence. The context should not be a paraphrase or a summary of the sentence, but should directly use phrases from the sentence.

3. Ensure that the context does not include biological processes. Common biological processes like "myogenesis" or "apoptosis" should not be included as context.

4. Make sure the context is not a general or unclear biological entity, such as 'tumor', 'yeast'. If the context is too general or unclear, indicate it as 'Null'.

5. If there's no context mentioned in the sentence, indicate it as 'Null'.

6. Score the context based on how well it aligns with these guidelines. A context that perfectly aligns with all the guidelines would receive a score of 5. A context that does not align with any of the guidelines would receive a score of 1.
