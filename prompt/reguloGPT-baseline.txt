Construct a graph including connected triplets (head node, edge, tail node) to represent the molecular regulatory relationship described in the provided sentence. Follow these explicit guidelines:\
1. Nodes:\
   - **Only** represent biological molecules, entities such as pathways or biological processes, as nodes. Denote a node as a single biology entity.\
   - **Do Not** include context in the node unless the context is a complete node. For example, use only differentiation in 'mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation' as the node since the 'mouse embryonic stem cell' is the context. But node must be a noun biological molecules or entities.\
   - Regard phrases like the A/B/C or (A-B-C) “axis”, “pathway”, and “signaling” as a node. If there is no word such as “axis”, “pathway”, or “signaling” in the phrase, divide entities in A-B-C into separate nodes.  \
   - **Do Not** have any action nouns as a node, including upregulation, resistance, exposure, resilience, regulation, suppression, or targeting, because they are not biological entities.\
   - **Do Not** combine multiple parallel biological entities connected with ‘and’ as a node. Extract each entity as a separate node.\
   - Introduce a “dummy” node if no entity is defined for a regulation in the sentence. \
2. Edges:\
   - Use an edge to represent the regulatory relationship between a head and a tail node described by the action nouns or verbs.\
   - The edge value should be a single-word predicate (or a concise description) that describes the direct relationship between the head and tail nodes.\
   - Use the word from the original sentence as the edge value as much as possible. If not possible, use generic word such as regulate, up-regulate, or down-regulate.\
   - 'is on' can be used as a relationship in the edge. **Do Not** use other prepositions, such as 'of', or 'in' as a relationship.\
   - **Do Not** include more than two nodes in an edge. If multiple nodes point to one node or one node points to multiple nodes, split them into multiple edges. \
3. Context:\
   - It refers to the broader biological context such as a specific diseases (like a type of cancer).\
   - Directly use phrases in the input.\
   - **Do not** include biological processes as a part of the context. Common biological processes (like \"myogenesis\" or \"apoptosis\") should NOT be included as context but rather represented within the graph.\
   - ***Do not** just include unclear or general biological entities, such as 'tumor', 'yeast'. In this case, indicate it as 'Null'.\
   - If there's no context mentioned, indicate it as 'Null'.\
4. Inferred Edges:\
   - Include any relationships that can be logically derived but aren't directly stated in the provided sentence.\
   - **Only** include inferred edge to make the graph complete. Do not introduce extra relationships. \
For each sentence, format your answer as:\
- Context => [Context or 'Null']\
- Graph:\
  - nodes=> a list of nodes. For example, Node 1: HNRNPA2B1, Node 2: Progression.\
  - Direct edges=> a list of direct edges with descriptions. For example, Edge 1: From Node 1 to Node 2; edge value: promote. It denotes that HNRNPA2B promotes progression.\
  - Inferred edges=> a list of inferred edges with descriptions
